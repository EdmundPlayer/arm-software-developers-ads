[Arm Instruction Emulator](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Instruction%20Emulator) is a software tool that runs on 64-bit Arm platforms and emulates [Scalable Vector Extension(SVE)](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102476/latest/instructions). This tool allows you to run your compiled SVE application binaries on hardware that is not SVE-enabled.

## Prerequisites

Arm Instruction Emulator is an executable that runs on your Linux host. It runs on RHEL, SLES, and Ubuntu Linux distributions.

You must ensure that either [Environment Modules](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or the [Lmod Environment Module System](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are installed on your host Linux machine.

On the supported Linux hosts, use `gcc 7.1.0` or higher

## Download installer packages

You can download the appropriate Arm Instruction emulator package for your host Linux platform from [Product Downloads section](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-instruction-emulator) of the Arm website. 

Full installation instructions are provided [here](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102190/latest/Get-started/Install-Arm-Instruction-Emulator).

Arm Instruction Emulator is freely available and not license managed. You can view the third party license information for the open source software included with the latest version of Arm Instruction Emulator [here](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-instruction-emulator/third-party-licenses)

## Get started {#start}

To verify everything is working OK post-install refer to [Get started with Arm Instruction Emulator](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102190/latest/Get-started/Get-started-with-Arm-Instruction-Emulator).

This uses a couple of simple examples to demonstrate how to compile Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) code and run the resulting binary with Arm Instruction Emulator.
