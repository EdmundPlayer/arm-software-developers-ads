title: "Processing Text in Mixed C/Assembly Language" 
# Should start with a verb, have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

description: >
    In this exercise, you will execute assembly code on the Nucleo-F401RE board using the debugger to examine its execution at the processor level.

# One sentance, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

minutes_to_complete: 60
# Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

who_is_this_for: >
    This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in efficiently programming microcontrollers with C/Assembly.
# One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

learning_objectives: 
    - Write a mixed C program and assembly language subroutines for the microcontroller. 
    - Call the subroutines written in assembly in a C function.  
    - Use Arm register calling conventions when writing subroutines in assembly language.  
    - Use a suitable debugging tool to view and analyse the processor state.  
# 2-5 bullet points, one sentance each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with C/Assembly
    - Installed Keil MDK IDE
    - Have an STM32 Nucleo F401RE development board
