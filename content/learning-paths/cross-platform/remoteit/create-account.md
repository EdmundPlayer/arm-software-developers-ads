## Before you begin

Any Windows, macOS, or Linux computer with a browser can be used for this section. 

[Remote.it](https://www.remote.it) provides simple, secure connections between computers. Support for multiple operating systems and different Arm hardware make it a useful tool for developers. Remote.it creates connections to virtual machines running in the public cloud and to single board computers running on your desk at work or at home. 

## Definitions

For this Learning Path, **computer** refers to a laptop, desktop, server, single board computer, tablet, or phone. 

An **initiator device** is the computer you want to connect from, normally the computer in front of you.

A **target device** is the computer you want to connect to, normally a remote computer you want to access. A target device may also be referred to as an **endpoint**. 

A **service** is a configuration on the remote device used to access an application. SSH and VNC are examples of services.

## Account creation

You can try remote.it by creating a personal account. Personal accounts limit the number of target devices and are for non-commercial use. A personal account is a good way to try remote.it for free and evaluate the results.  

Create an account using the [remote.it web application](https://app.remote.it/)

After account creation, log in to see the dashboard in your browser.

Remote.it works nearly the same for any type of target device. A Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS works the same way as an Arm server from a cloud service provider.

Remote.it provides safe, secure networking connections between initiator devices and target devices. Itâ€™s important to remember remote.it assumes the required software services are correctly installed and configured. For example, if you want to access a remote device using SSH then an SSH server must be configured and running.

The next sections highlight common ways developers use remote.it.
