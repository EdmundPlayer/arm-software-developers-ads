title: "AXI-Lite and GPIOs" 
# Should start with a verb, have no adjectives (amazing, cool, etc.), and be as concise as possible.

description: >
    Design and implement AXI-Lite peripheral to control General Purpose Input and Output Ports (GPIOs). 

# One sentance, is a quick summary of this learning path, viewable when searching through all learning paths. 

minutes_to_complete: 60
# Always measured in minutes. Should be an integer, to complete the learning path (not just read it).

who_is_this_for: >
    This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in System on Chip Design.
# One sentence that should indicate exactly who the target audience is (developers in X industries using Y tools/software for Z use-case).

learning_objectives: 
    - Configure and integrate an AXI-Lite peripheral with a Cortex-A9 Processing System.
    - Modify a C code to program the Cortex-A9 processor so that it reads the state of switches and control the LEDs.
    - Demonstrate a functional simple system that lights up the LEDs based on the status of the switches.  
# 2-5 bullet points, one sentance each. Should start with a verb (Deploy, Measure) and indicate the value of the objective if possible.

prerequisites:
    - Some familiarity with Verilog
    - Basic understanding of System on Chip
    - Have a 'Zybo Z7-10' development board
